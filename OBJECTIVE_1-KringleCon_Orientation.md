## PROCEDURE : ##

Easy enough – just click on the guy by the gate and see what he has to say and click on your badge.  Create a Crypto Wallet at the KringleCoin Teller Machine (KTM) and **_keep a note of the wallet address and key!_**  Finally, click on the Cranberry Pi terminal that has magically appeared on the table next to Jingle Ringford.  Follow the on-screen prompt in the terminal and you’re free to walk through the Gates and meet Santa.

Santa explains that everyone is snowed out of the castle and that his five gold rings have gone missing and that without them he has lost his magical abilities….  Let the adventure begin!
