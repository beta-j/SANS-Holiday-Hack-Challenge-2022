## PROCEDURE : ##
Based on the hints we are given for this objective it looks like weâ€™re going to need to use **XML injection** to crack this.  We are presented with an image of Glamtariel and one of her fountain and a number of objects we can drag onto either one of them.  For every item we drag the fountain and Glamtariel give us some information â€“ some of the words are in CAPS and one of the hints seems to indicate that we should pay special attention to these words:
**`PATH, TRAFFIC FLIES, TAMPER, APP , TYPE, SIMPLE FORMAT, RINGLIST`**

Using Burpsuite to intercept the web requests we see that the site is using json to format its messages.  However, if we change the `Content-Type` to `xml` and convert the json payload to xml format (I used [https://www.freeformatter.com/json-to-xml-converter.html](https://www.freeformatter.com/json-to-xml-converter.html) for this), the website seems to still function normally â€“ so it looks like we can feed the website xml formatted payloads instead of json.

Glamtariel conveniently tells us that she keeps all of her rings in her `RINGLIST` file and that she likes using a SIMPLE FORMAT for such a list â€“ so in all likelihood we must be looking for a file called `ringlist.txt`.

Now that weâ€™ve determined that we can pass on XML to the website we can try a basic test for XXE vulnerability by using a `REPLACE` ([I used code found here for this bit](https://github.com/payloadbox/xxe-injection-payload-list)).  Instead of passing `img4` directly as the value for `imgDrop` we assign it to a variable called `example` and then pass the contents of `example` to `imgDrop`. In this case the response we receive is exactly the same â€“ which is great news because it means that the site is vulnerable to XXE ðŸ˜Š

Now we can try a more complex file disclosure attack by passing the path of a file we want to peek into.   Weâ€™re assuming that weâ€™re looking for a file called `ringlist.txt` and by inspecting the website sources we know that there are a number of directories as follows:
```
/static/css/
/static/images/
/static/js
```
![image](https://github.com/beta-j/SANS-Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2022/assets/60655500/4bfdae8a-beea-46de-a332-d80857041e51)

Oh...and we mustnâ€™t forget that to prepend the `/app/` directory (Thatâ€™s what the â€˜APPâ€™ hint was for!)

So, we can craft a payload to look for `ringlist.txt` in these directories, eg:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY ent SYSTEM "file:///app/static/images/ringlist.txt"> ]>
<root>
	<imgDrop>&ent;</imgDrop>
	<reqType>xml</reqType>
	<who>princess</who>
</root>
```
This returns a Pretty interesting response â€“ we did get the contents of the `ringlist.txt` but apparently Glamtariel doesnâ€™t keep her secrets there anymore.  However, we are told to visit  `https://glamtarielsfountain.com/static/images/pholder-morethantopsupersecret63842.png` where we are served up an image of a top-secret looking manila folder. 

![image](https://github.com/beta-j/SANS-Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2022/assets/60655500/01b6d5bb-39c9-4198-b0f3-b3da7bb4ac14)




Looking closely at the folder we see that the folder itself is labelled `x_phial_pholder_2022` and that it has two files in it called `bluering.txt` and `redring.txt`.  By modifying the xml payload, we used earlier we can peek into the contents of these two text files that are located in the `/app/static/images/x_phial_pholder/2022/` directory.

### Bluering.txt: ###
>"I love these fancy blue rings! You can see we have two of them. Not magical or anything, just really pretty.^She definitely tries to convince everyone that the blue ones are her favorites. I'm not so sure though.",

### Redring.txt: ###
>â€œHmmm, you still seem awfully interested in these rings. I can't blame you, they are pretty nice.^Oooooh, I can just tell she'd like to talk about them some more.",

...thatâ€™s nothing we donâ€™t know already â€“ so all this work for nothing?!  Well... maybe not... the website shows us two blue rings, a red ring and a fourth silver ring.  So maybe thereâ€™s a third file called `silverring.txt`? Itâ€™s definitely worth a shot...and sure enough we find another message inside `silverring.txt`:

![image](https://github.com/beta-j/SANS-Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2022/assets/60655500/c862e094-dd2b-400e-aa01-2edb7da66f93)

### Silverring.txt: ###
```
  "appResp": "I'd so love to add that silver ring to my collection, but what's this? Someone has defiled my red ring! Click it out of the way please!.^Can't say that looks good. Someone has been up to no good. Probably that miserable Grinchum!",
  "droppedOn": "none",
  "visit":"static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/redring-supersupersecret928164.png,267px,127px"
```
Thereâ€™s another hint pointing us towards a new URL for a new png file â€“ loading that up gives us a close-up view of the red ring.   Thereâ€™s an inscription on the inside of the ring that says `goldring_to_be_deleted.txt`.

Now things are surely getting interesting â€“ thereâ€™s a fifth ring which is set to be deleted â€“ maybe we can have a peek into `goldring_to_be_deleted.txt` using the same XXE method...

![image](https://github.com/beta-j/SANS-Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2022/assets/60655500/3b945782-3e0e-4d0a-8714-3634b611472d)


### Goldring_to_be_deleted.txt: ###
> "Hmmm, and I thought you wanted me to take a look at that pretty silver ring, but instead, you've made a pretty bold REQuest. That's ok, but even if I knew anything about such things, I'd only use a secret TYPE of tongue to discuss them.^She's definitely hiding something.",

This is quite a cryptic message, but so far this objective has shown that looking at the words in CAPS helps point in the right direction.  In this case we have `REQTYPE`.  After spending hours hammering away at this objective â€“ this is immediately familiar.  We are passing on three variables in our xml payload; `imgDrop`, `who` and `reqType`. 
So far, weâ€™ve been passing our XXE payload to the `imgDrop` variable, but maybe we should try passing it to `reqType` instead:

```diff
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY ent SYSTEM "file:///app/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/goldring_to_be_deleted.txt"> ]>
<root>
-	<imgDrop>&ent;</imgDrop>
- <reqType>xml</reqType>
+	<imgDrop>img1</imgDrop>
+	<reqType>&ent;</reqType>
	<who>princess</who>
</root>
```

We now get the following response:
```
  "appResp": "No, really I couldn't. Really? I can have the beautiful silver ring? I shouldn't, but if you insist, I accept! In return, behold, one of Kringle's golden rings! Grinchum dropped this one nearby. Makes one wonder how 'precious' it really was to him. Though I haven't touched it myself, I've been keeping it safe until someone trustworthy such as yourself came along. Congratulations!^Wow, I have never seen that before! She must really trust you!",
  "droppedOn": "none",
  "visit":"static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/goldring-morethansupertopsecret76394734.png,200px,290px"
```

And behold we are given a URL to the gold ring and the answer to this objective: **`goldring-morethansupertopsecret76394734.png`**!
