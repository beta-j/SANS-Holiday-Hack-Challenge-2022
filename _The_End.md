# The End #

And just like that all five rings were recovered and returned to Santa who was able to re-open his castle and invite us in!

This was my fifth year participating in the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge and the third time I managed to complete the whole thing.  It’s always been a really enjoyable event that keeps me coming year after year and I’m always immensely impressed by the level of hard work and creativity that goes into organising it every year.

Heartfelt thanks to the [fantastic team at SANS](https://www.sans.org/mlp/holiday-hack-challenge#credits) – rest assured that you’ll be seeing me again next year!
